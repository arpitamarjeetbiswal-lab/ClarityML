# ClarityML 🧠✨

ClarityML is a human-centered machine learning application that helps users turn confusion into clarity.

It analyzes free-text thoughts to:
- Detect mental states (confused, anxious, avoidant, clear, motivated)
- Show confidence scores for predictions
- Explain *why* a prediction was made using key influencing words
- Suggest simple, actionable next steps

## 🔍 How It Works
- Text is vectorized using TF-IDF
- A Logistic Regression model predicts mental states
- Explainable AI highlights important words
- A Streamlit UI enables real-time interaction

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas & NumPy
- Streamlit
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🎯 Goal
ClarityML focuses on **decision clarity and self-reflection**, not generic chatbot responses.
